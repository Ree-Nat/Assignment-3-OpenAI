## Challenges I Faced
**Challenge 1: Spotify API Deprecated Features**
Problem: The spoty API features that we were planning to use - getReccomendation and getAudioFeatures - were depracated.
Solution: Instead of using Spotify's getReccomendation and getAudioFeatures, we decided to use Open AI to do it for us. 
We will implement 2 buttons to get song recommendations and to get audio features using Open AI
Learned: 
- Always check API documentation to ensure features are not deprecated
- There are usually alternatives when features are not longer in service 

**Challenge 2: OPEN AI API Cost**
Problem: Open AI's api was not free. It costs money to use
Solution: Signing up with our school email instead of our personal email seemed to resolved the problem, allowing us to use Open AI's api.
Learned: Sometimes student accounts are able to access paid services for free

## Design Pattern Justifications
**Strategy Pattern:** 
**DTO Pattern:** We decided to use a DTO pattern instead of a traditional structure 
**Observer Pattern:** 

## AI Usage
Used ChatGPT to help set up Open AI's api key

## Time Spent: ~20 hours
